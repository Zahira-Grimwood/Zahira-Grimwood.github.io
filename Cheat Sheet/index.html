<h1>How to use Colours in CSS...</h1>
    <!--Hexadecimal or Hex Colors-->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Hexadecimal or Hex Colours</h2>
            <h3>What is it?</h3>
                <p>Hexadecimal (Hex) is a number system that has sixteen digits, 0 to 9 followed by “A” to “F”. 
                    Hex values always begin with # and specify values of red, blue, and green.</p>
            <h3>Example... </h3>
                <p>An example of a Hex color representation is <span class="blue">#123456.</span> 12 is red, 34 is Green, and 56 is Blue 
                    and together the values make <span class="blue">blue.</span></p>
    </div>
    <!--RGB Colors-->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>RGB</h2>
        <h3>What is it?</h3>
                <p>RGB colors use the rgb() syntax with one value for red, one value for blue and one value for green. 
                    RGB values range from 0 to 255.</p>
        <h3>Example...</h3>
                <p>An example of an RGB value is <span class="red">rgb(255, 0, 0)</span> which makes <span class="red">red.</span></p>
    </div>
    <!--HSL Colours-->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>HSL</h2>
        <h3>What is it?</h3>
                <p>HSL stands for hue (the color itself), saturation (the intensity of the color), 
                    and lightness (how light or dark a color is). Hue ranges from 0 to 360 and saturation 
                    and lightness are both represented by percentages.</p>
        <h3>Example...</h3>
                <p>An example of an HSL value is <span class="green">hsl(74, 73%, 51%)</span> which is <span class="green">green.</span></p>
